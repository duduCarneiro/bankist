# 👨‍💻 About

This project is part of the content of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/" target="_blank">The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtman</a> available on Udemy 🔔! 
<br> Bankist stands for minimalist banking and so this is why we built this kind of online bank interface with minimal design.

## 🚀 Get started

you can access the app on: [souvenir-app-lw.herokuapp.com](https://souvenir-app-lw.herokuapp.com/) 🚙. <br>


## ✍️ Usage and examples

After the login (Fake "log in" with user `ze@ninguem.com` and password `123456`), you can 
and so you can just basically log in.
So write JS and then the pin is 1111.
And so Bankist stands for minimalist banking
and so this is why we have this kind of banking.
So an online bank interface.
So we have all the movements here,
we have the overall balance of the account up here.
Then we have some summary data down here
and here on the right side
we have three options that we can do.
So we can transfer money to someone else,
we can requst a loan from the bank
and we can close the account.
So lets request a loan here.
Lets say I need
1,000 euros.
So I click here
and then after some time it is approved
and it appears here as a deposit.
Okay.
Then I can also transfer money
and there is a user called JD.
And lets say I wanna transfer 5,000.
So lets try that.
And so now I have 5,000 less than I use to have.
Finally we can also sort these here.
So now they are sorted
and now they are back to normal.
And now lets go to that other account JD
with the pin of
2222
and so lets check out if she has a deposit of 5,000.And indeed here it is.
We also see that this account here is in US dollars
and with the American formatting
while the other one was in euros.
And so that's something
that we're gonna take care of in the next section.
But in this section we will actually take care
of displaying all of these movements,
making these operations here possible,
calculating the statistics as well as the current balance
and so yah, I think it's gonna be a lot of fun
and I'm really happy with this application.
I think it looks amazing,
it also looks like a real world use case
and yah, overall
this is a great project for training Arrays
because we can do lots of these stuffthat you see here on the screen using Arrays.Great, so now that you have a feeling
for how this application works
lets take a look at a flow chart that I designed
